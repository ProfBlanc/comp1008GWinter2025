Inheritance
    creating class BASED on another class
        Do not re-reinvent the wheel
            D           R           Y

            do not      repeat      yourself


    What is inherited?
        non-private
            instance variables
            methods
        EXCEPT: constructors. constructors are not inherited

    Java only support single-class inheritance


    Super Class                             Sub Class
    Base  Class                             Derived Class
    Parent Class                            Child Class


    newer version of class              older version of class


    A Sub Class IS-AN instance/version of a Super Class

Polymorphism
    many forms
        Override: new version
        Overload: new variation
            both demonstrate polymorphism

    Abstract
        class that cannot be instantiated
            class that stores common traits
        class that is incomplete
            has an idea but no default implementation (body)
        Shape
            default formula for area?


    Interface
        list of requirements
            series of method definitions & constants
                no: anything else (constructors, instance variables, etc)
